All of the necessary steps to get your IBM Cloud billing data into IBM Cloudability are managed for you using infrastructure as code (IaC). This includes the following:\n\n1. Creating a Key Protect encrypted Object Storage buckets to store your billing reports.\n2. Enabling IBM Cloud to write billing reports to the bucket daily.\n3. Grant IBM Cloudability access to read the reports from the bucket\n4. Add your IBM Cloud account to Cloudability.\n5. Verify that the IBM Cloud integration with Cloudability is successful.\n\nYour IBM Cloud billing data will begin showing up in IBM Cloudability the next day. \nTo get started [create your access credentials](/docs/track-spend-with-cloudability?topic=track-spend-with-cloudability-planning) and then [deploy the deployable architecture with projects](/docs/track-spend-with-cloudability?topic=track-spend-with-cloudability-deploy-cloud) . \nIf you don't have an IBM Cloudability account then start by creating your [free trial](https://www.apptio.com/products/cloudability/#cldy-trial).",
